Mankinholes is the starting point for the popular trek up Stoodley Pike, ""Pike"" being a North-country term for a mountain or large hill. The hill is surmounted by a 19th-century obelisk, 120 feet (37 m) high, also known as ""Stoodley Pike"", commemorating the end of the Crimean War. The name ""Mankin"" is believed to have Celtic origins, with the OED recording its first meaning as ""fierce wild man"". The surname Mankin is found in parish records of the township of Langfield and the parish of Halifax. One theory is that the name derives from an area of caverns, inhabited by mankins. A second theory is that the name means ""Mancan\'s Hollow"", with Mancan being an Irish surname, suggesting Irish-Viking settlers. Mankinholes was an early centre of Wesleyan Methodism. Groups met in farmhouses as early as the late 18th century and the first chapel was built in 1814. This was enlarged in 1870 and rebuilt in 1911. An adjacent Sunday School was built in 1833. Mankinholes Methodist Church closed on 1 July 1979, when the congregation joined with that of Lumbutts Methodist Church, situated midway between the villages of Mankinholes and Lumbutts. The Mankinholes Sunday School building still stands and is now a private house, surrounded by a large graveyard. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough. Bradford forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and is the fourth largest urban area in the United Kingdom[2] with the Bradford subdivision of the aforementioned urban area having a population of 528,155.[1][not in citation given] Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Bradford rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture, particularly wool. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements, rapidly becoming the ""wool capital of the world"".[3] The area\'s access to a supply of coal, iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford\'s manufacturing base, which, as textile manufacture grew, led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment; Bradford has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand Italianate City Hall.[4] The textile sector in Bradford fell into decline from the mid-20th century. Since this time, Bradford has emerged as a tourist destination, becoming the first UNESCO City of Film with attractions such as the National Media Museum, Bradford City Park, the Alhambra theatre and Cartwright Hall.

It is located within the historic boundaries of the North Riding of Yorkshire. Situated on the east coast of Yorkshire at the mouth of the River Esk, Whitby has an established maritime, mineral and tourist heritage. Its East Cliff is home to the ruins of Whitby Abbey, where C\xe6dmon, the earliest recognised English poet, lived. The fishing port developed during the Middle Ages, supporting important herring and whaling fleets, and was (along with the nearby fishing village of Staithes) where Captain Cook learned seamanship. Tourism started in Whitby during the Georgian period and developed further on the arrival of the railway in 1839. Its attraction as a tourist destination is enhanced by its proximity to the high ground of the North York Moors National Park, its Heritage Coastline and by its association with the horror novel Dracula. Jet and alum were mined locally. Whitby Jet, which was mined by the Romans and Victorians, became fashionable during the 19th century. The earliest record of a permanent settlement is in 656, when as Strean\u0153healh it was the place where Oswy, the Christian king of Northumbria, founded the first abbey, under the abbess Hilda. The Synod of Whitby was held there in 664. In 867, the monastery was destroyed by Viking raiders. Another monastery was founded in 1078. It was in this period that the town gained its current name, Whitby (from ""white settlement"" in Old Norse). In the following centuries Whitby functioned as a fishing settlement until, in the 18th century, it developed as a port and centre for shipbuilding and whaling, the trade in locally mined alum, and the manufacture of Whitby jet jewellery. The abbey ruin at the top of the East Cliff is the town\'s oldest and most prominent landmark. Other significant features include the swing bridge, which crosses the River Esk and the harbour, which is sheltered by the grade II listed East and West piers. The town\'s maritime heritage is commemorated by statues of Captain Cook and William Scoresby, as well as the whalebone arch that sits at the top of the West Cliff. The town also has a strong literary tradition and has featured in literary works, television and cinema, most famously in Bram Stoker\'s novel Dracula. While Whitby\'s cultural and historical heritage contribute to the local economy, the town does suffer from the economic constraints of its remote location, ongoing changes in the fishing industry, relatively underdeveloped transport infrastructure, and limitations on available land and property. As a result, tourism and some forms of fishing remain the mainstay of its economy. It is the closest port to a proposed wind farm development in the North Sea, 47 miles (76 km) from York and 22 miles (35 km) from Middlesbrough. There are transport links to the rest of North Yorkshire and North East England, primarily through national rail links to Middlesbrough and road links to Teesside, via both the A171 and A174, and Scarborough by the former. According to the 2011 UK census, the town had a population of 13,213, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 13,594. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em><br /><br /></span>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

Goathland village is 500 feet above sea level and has a history extending from Viking times. The name Goathland is probably a corruption of \'good land\'. Alternatively, it may come from \'Goda\'s land\', Goda being an Old English personal name. In 1109 King Henry I granted land to Osmund the Priest and the brethren of the hermitage of Goathland, then called Godelandia, for the soul of his mother Queen Matilda, who had died in 1083. This is recorded in a charter held at Whitby Abbey. The village was a spa town in the 19th century. There are many hotels and guest houses in the village, the largest, the Mallyan Spout Hotel, is named after a nearby waterfall. There is a caravan site, reached by driving along the track which is the site of the older railway route, 1835 to 1860. Much of the surrounding land is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster. The Duchy\'s tenants have a common right extending for hundreds of years to graze their black faced sheep on the village green and surrounding moorland. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure, the Laver and Skell. The city is noted for its main feature, Ripon Cathedral which is architecturally significant, as well as the Ripon Racecourse and other features such as its market. The city itself is just over 1,300 years old. The city was originally known as Inhrypum and was founded by Saint Wilfrid during the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria, a period during which it enjoyed prominence in terms of religious importance in Great Britain. It was for a period under Viking control, and later suffered under the Normans. After a brief period of building projects under the Plantagenets, the city emerged with a prominent wool and cloth industry. Ripon became well known for its production of spurs during the 16th and 17th centuries, but would later remain largely unaffected by the Industrial Revolution. Ripon is the third smallest city in England. According to the 2011 United Kingdom Census it had a population of 16,702, an increase on the 2001 United Kingdom Census figure of 15,922. It is located 11 miles (18 km) south-west of Thirsk, 16 miles (26 km) south of Northallerton and 12 miles (19 km) north of Harrogate. As well as its racecourse and cathedral, Ripon is a tourist destination because of its close proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site which consists of the Studley Royal Park and Fountains Abbey. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

It is located in the valley of the River Wharfe and is only 1 mile (2 km) from the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The name is thought to mean ""homestead associated with a man called Adda"", although in the Domesday Book, the village was referred to as ""Ediham"", which may have referred to Earl Edwin of Bolton Abbey. The 2001 census numbered Addingham\'s population at 3,599, increasing to 3,730 at the 2011 Census. The area around Addingham is thought to have been populated from at least Bronze Age times, indicated by the \'cup and ring\' carved stones that can be found on Addingham Moor. Its beginnings may date back to the late Mesolithic period, as evidenced by the scattered remains of early flint tools across Rombald\'s Moor to the south. The earliest of the existing houses were built in the 17th century when the village was a farming community, but the real growth began in the late 18th century and early 19th century when the textile industry arrived and five working mills, plus other loomshops and weaving sheds, were established, and the village developed into a busy industrial community. The village grew up around three centres; Church Street in the east; The Green, about a mile away in the west; and The Old School in between. This is thought[by whom?] to be one of the reasons the village used to be known as ""Long Addingham"". Since the decline of the textile industry during the 20th century, the village has now become largely a commuter and retirement community.

At the end of the steep descent from Hinderwell village, you have to leave cars in the car park and explore the village on foot. Many cottages have been lost to the sea over the centuries. Though the village is now protected by a sea-wall, the rate of erosion can be judged from the row of beach huts on the cliff to the south of the village. This is the last of five such rows that stood on the site years ago. In order to increase the family income, the fisherfolk would live in such huts during the summer months while letting their cottages to the artists and holiday-makers who flocked to the village after the railway was built. Runswick BayOne benefit of the continued erosion of the cliffs is the constantly refreshed supply of fossils. Ammonites abound, locked into small ironstone pebbles scattered along the beach. The fossil remains of a Plesiosaurus and an Ichthyosaurus were found here a century ago and are now in Whitby Museum. The local lifeboat is still actively supported and has a brave history. On one occasion, the womenfolk of the village launched and crewed the boat, to rescue their menfolk who had been caught offshore in a freak squall. Local legends include the Boggles of Claymore Well and Hob of Hob Hole. <em>Source: visitwhitby.com</em>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

In the 2011 Census the population of the parish was 35,369.[1] Bridlington is a minor sea fishing port with a working harbour and is well known for its shellfish. It has a mix of small businesses across the manufacturing, retail and service sectors with its prime trade being tourism during the summer months. The origins of the town are uncertain, but archaeological evidence shows habitation in the Bronze Age and in Roman times. The settlement at the Norman conquest was called Bretlinton, but has also gone by the names of Berlington, Brellington and Britlington, before settling on its modern name in the 19th century.[2] The town is twinned with Millau in France and Bad Salzuflen in Germany.[3] One of the UK\'s coastal weather stations is located at Bridlington. The Priory Church of St Mary and the associated Bayle Gate are Grade I listed buildings. The church stands on the site of the original Augustine Priory.

This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses. The area including fellow nearby town of Bramham was used for filming external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny. The village has a lovely church ""St Mary\'s"" and a very old pub ""The Lord Nelson"" where Branwell Bronte once drank and is asserted to have established the first public library in one of the upstairs rooms. In recent years the village has reestablished the position of Village Mayor, the role is primarily about raising funds for local charitable causes and investment in the village.<br /><br /><em>Source: Wikipedia</em>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/41', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 41, u'name': u'Description'}}, {u'text': u'<div class=""_cgc"">\n<div class=""r-i_1Y9kQqci_E"">\n<div class=""kno-rdesc r-iy0hqxqb9MFI""><span>Luddenden is a district of Calderdale west of Halifax on the river Ludd in the county of West Yorkshire, England.</span><span><a class=""fl q _KCd _tWc"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddenden"">Wikipedia</a></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

Hodgson Fowler in Decorated style, largely with bequests from the Palmer family of Grinkle Park, and incorporated fragments and remains of the previous church. The side chapel and several of the furnishings are by the firm of 'Mousey' Thompson of Kilburn. The village public house, the Tiger Inn, was previously a building of the same name at the opposite end of the village. The village had a railway station on the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway. The station was opened in 1883 as Easington, the name changing in 1904 to Grinkle after the local house and seat of the Baronets Palmer, Grinkle Park. The renaming was to avoid confusion with the station at the larger Easington, County Durham, also on the North Eastern Railway's network.

The outer stone walls stayed upright during the fire, but because of the threat of explosions from the acid baths if they came into contact with water, two houses were evacuated as a precaution. The factories were bounded on the south by Long Lane (the B6429) on the east by Keighley Road, on the west by Effingham Road and the north by fields leading up to Harden Moor. The company relocated to Glusburn in 1997 and the factory was demolished to make way for housing. At Least two other mills were in operation in Harden, both situated alongside Harden Beck to the south of the village. One of the mills is still there and now operates as a printing works. The other mill was further upstream from the existing mill and during the early part of the 20th century was turned into a caf\xe9 and ballroom.

Since 2013, polls have consistently voted the town as ""the happiest place to live"" in Britain. Harrogate spa water contains iron, sulphur and common salt. The town became known as \'The English Spa\' in the Georgian era, after its waters were discovered in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries its \'chalybeate\' waters (containing iron) were a popular health treatment, and the influx of wealthy but sickly visitors contributed significantly to the wealth of the town. Harrogate railway station and Harrogate bus station in the town centre provide transport connections. Leeds Bradford International Airport is 10 miles (16 km) south-west of Harrogate. The main roads through the town are the A61, connecting Harrogate to Leeds and Ripon, and the A59, connecting the town to York and Skipton. Harrogate is also connected to Wetherby and the A1, by the A661.

The Battle of Wakefield took place in the Wars of the Roses and it was a Royalist stronghold in the Civil War. Wakefield became an important market town and centre for wool, exploiting its position on the navigable River Calder to become an inland port. In the 18th century, Wakefield traded in corn, coal mining and textiles and in 1888 its parish church acquired cathedral status. It became the county town and seat of the West Riding County Council in 1889 and the West Yorkshire Metropolitan Council from 1974 until it was dissolved in 1986. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em></span></span>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}, {u'text': u'<span>\xa0</span>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/39', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 39, u'name': u'Creator'}}]"

Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, Leeds can be traced to the 5th century name for a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool.\r\n\r\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry, but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire, in the 16th century, Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016), making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3 million.\r\n\r\nToday, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres. It has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities, with 77% of the Leeds workforce working in the private sector. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area, with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area. Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth largest student population in the country and the country's fourth largest urban economy.\r\n\r\nAfter London, Leeds is the largest legal and financial centre in the UK, and in 2011 its financial and insurance services industry was worth \xa32.1 billion, with more than 30 national and international banks located in the city including the only subsidiary office of the Bank of England in the UK . Leeds is also the UK's third largest manufacturing centre with around 1,800 firms and 39,000 employees, Leeds manufacturing firms account for 8.8% of total employment in the city. The largest sub-sectors are engineering, printing and publishing, food and drink, chemicals and medical technology. The city is the home of several firsts, including the oldest surviving film in existence, Roundhay Garden Scene (1888), and the 1767 invention of soda water, the defining component of most soft drinks.\r\n\r\nOutside London, Leeds has the third busiest railway station and tenth-busiest airport in terms of passenger numbers in England. Public transport, rail and road communications networks in the region are focused on Leeds. Its assigned role in the Leeds City Region partnership recognises the city's importance to regional economic development, and the second phase of High Speed 2 plans to connect Leeds to London via East Midlands Hub and Sheffield Meadowhall.\r\nSource: Wikipedia"", u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71 AD. It became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Northumbria and J\xf3rv\xedk. In the Middle Ages, York grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the Church of England, a role it has retained. In the 19th century, York became a hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre. In recent decades, the economy of York has moved from being dominated by its confectionery and railway-related industries to one that provides services. The University of York and health services have become major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy. From 1996, the term City of York describes a unitary authority area which includes rural areas beyond the old city boundaries. In 2011 the urban area had a population of 153,717, while in 2010 the entire unitary authority had an estimated population of 202,400. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em>', u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

The village is situated approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) west from Haworth, 4 miles (6.4 km) south-west from Keighley, and 7 miles (11 km) east from Colne in Lancashire.  Less than half a mile north-east is the hamlet of Lumbfoot. The name Stanbury translates as Stone Fort from Old English. \r\n\r\nThe surrounding countryside is mainly moors and farmland. The village is close to the Bront\xeb waterfall and Top Withens tourist landmarks. Emily Bront\xeb is reputed to have used Top Withens as the model for the location of Wuthering Heights, and nearby Ponden Hall (half a mile from the edge of Stanbury) has been considered the model for 'Thrushcross Grange' in the same book.  It has also been theorized that Ponden Hall is actually the setting for Top Withens as its size is smaller than that of Thrushcross Grange as described in the book.  There are also additional theories that the hall is the model for Wildfell Hall in Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. \r\n\r\nStanbury is Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The River Worth is immediately north of the village and Sladen Beck is just to the south. Ponden Reservoir was built in the 1870s  and a reservoir was approved to be built at Lower Laithe on Sladen Beck in 1869, but it was not started until 1911. Due to the nation being involved in the First World War, the reservoir was not completed until 1925. Its completion necessitated the abandonment of the hamlet of Smith Bank. \r\n\r\nThere is an Anglican church in Stanbury which was built in 1848. In 1998, it was named St Gabriels, after spending the previous 150 years without a name.[11] The school caters for primary school age children. There are also two public houses: The Friendly and the Wuthering Heights which dates from 1763 and was formerly and locally known as 'The Cross'. The Old Silent Inn (formerly The Eagle) is a public house and guest house close to the village which is over 400 years old. \r\n\r\nTwo paths pass through the village; The Bronte Way and The Pennine way. \r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia"", u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"

It is situated between Driffield and Bridlington approximately 6 miles (9.7 km) to the west of Bridlington, and lies on the B1253 road. The Gypsey Race (an intermittent stream) runs through the village, which lies in the Great Wold Valley. There are a number of Neolithic sites associated with the stream and its valley. It is the current Seat of the Clan Macdonald of Sleat.\r\nAccording to the 2011 UK census, Rudston parish had a population of 409, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 390..\r\n\r\nThe place-name 'Rudston' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, and means 'rood' or 'cross' stone, referring to the monolith.. However, the name 'rud' derives from Old Norse ru\xf0, meaning a clearing or pasture. So the place name could be stone in the clearing, Ru\xf0stane. Nearby Howes of Duggleby and Ba'l (In Ugaritic mythology Baal is the lord of the storm; he bears a mace where Thor will grasp a hammer) also indicate Norse Viking place names rather than Anglo-Saxon origins.\r\n\r\nHere stands the Rudston Monolith; at over 25 feet (7.6 m) tall, it is the tallest standing stone in England, and gave the village its name; it is Grade I listed..\r\n\r\nRudston is the centre of an unparalleled grouping of four Neolithic cursus monuments: cursus A,. cursus B,. cursus C. and cursus D.. At least one end of each cursus rests on an elevated chalk ridge on the sides of the Great Wold Valley. Cursuses A and C cross the Gypsey Race, whilst the other ends of cursuses B and D probably lie under the village.\r\n\r\nRudston Roman villa, noted for its mosaics, was first excavated in 1839. It was subsequently re-excavated in the 1930s, 1960s and 1970s..\r\n\r\nRudston Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints. Of 14th-century origin, it was restored in 1861 by George Fowler Jones. It contains the gigantic organ, originally of four manuals, given by Sir Alexander McDonald of the Isles. Now a 3 manual instrument, it stands at the west end of the church in the original case. The author Winifred Holtby was born in Rudston and is buried in the church graveyard. Since September 2014, the North Aisle of the church has a small heritage area including a 3D map of the village with sites of interest noted and a set of information boards about the history of the village.\r\n\r\nThorpe Hall to the east of the village was designated a Grade II listed building in 1952 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia"", u'element_set': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/element_sets/1', u'resource': u'element_sets', u'id': 1, u'name': u'Dublin Core'}, u'element': {u'url': u'http://theafteraliceproject.org/api/elements/49', u'resource': u'elements', u'id': 49, u'name': u'Subject'}}]"
